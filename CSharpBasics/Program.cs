//1.1 Integral

//byte a = 255; //Its range is 0-255  -It is unsigned and takes sigle byte

//long d = 3456897213489;


//1.2 Floating point numbers, Precision

/*float e  = 45.6f ;//it can represent up to 6-7 digit after decimal and to approve it as decimal we should add suffix f on end.

//2. Text
string h = @"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  sf\d";
char i = 'M';
//Escape sequences: \n \t \r \b
Console.WriteLine("I am person. \n I live in earth");
//@ is called Verbatim character


//3.Boolean
//bool hh = true;

//Nullables
int? population  = null;
